USSD Project
Unstructured Supplementary Service Data Application
This is a layered application and its aim is message passing between server and clients that follows a communications protocol used by GSM cellular telephones to communicate with the mobile network operator's computers. USSD server methods used for providing services to clients such as callback services that responsible for the run, mobile-money services, location-based content services, menu-based information services, and as part of configuring the phone on the network. This project with aim of Java socket programming and a dependency framework that implemented by myself and ORM mapping that enabled that the DAO layer
  communicate with the desired database, facilitates the communication between nodes. Furthermore, in my architect design, there is a multi-thread layer that benefits from the REACT design pattern which provides strong asynchronous communication between a myriad of distributed clients and a server.
